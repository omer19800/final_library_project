This project spanning 2 weeks
includes multiple files:
  1) front end file - the __main__ file of the projects creating all the menues and everything
  2) library file - the "last line: the file taking all the seperate functions and classes and binding them together to all the major functions
  3) 3 JSON log files - customers, books, log - contain all the respective information - about the books and thier details, the customers and thier information, and a log of all loans and returnes
    *currently this file contains some sample information
  4) logger file - the "work horse" of my project - contains almost all of the functions that interact with the log files - all three of them.

this project was definitely a challenge, taking alot of time, quite a lot of sweat, a little bit of tears and many long nights coding.
